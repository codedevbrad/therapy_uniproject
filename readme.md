Developing a speech therapy application for a speech therapist that will give their patients the ability to do one-to-one and self-therapy on a more routine basis.


## build guide.

* npm i expo-cli -g
* create new .env file
* npm run fresh_install
* npm run app-run-all

## .env setup

TOKEN_SECRET = ''
NODE_ENV = 'development'

### Mongodb Atlas.
  Databases:
   - dev : 
      key = DB_ATLAS_dev  
   - production : 
      key = DB_ATLAS_prod 
   - test :
      key = DB_ATLAS_test

## things to acheive and improve.
   can I add features to implement to the github project board. this way, people could contribute?
     - limitation is that i'm unsure on how to properly accept and merge new pull requests. I know developers setup a testing policy  for commits to make sure changes don't break the app.
